# Surf Clock
## Hunter Waite Senior Project Spring/Fall 2021
### Overview
#### The goal of the surf clock is to aquire data using the Surfline V2 API and interpret that information to display on a final system to be determined. This repository holds all the code and will eventually hold all circuit designs and other designs that are defined by the project. Check back frequently for updates.
